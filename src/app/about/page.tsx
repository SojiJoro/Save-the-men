        <h1>About Save The Men</h1>
        <p style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
          Save The Men was born out of a series of discussions where Nigerian men
          abroad openly shared their struggles—especially around domestic abuse and cultural stigma.
          These conversations revealed a gap in support: men often felt they had no safe space to
          voice their experiences or seek help.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          Our mission is to <strong>empower Nigerian men worldwide</strong> by providing resources,
          advocacy, and a strong community network. We strive to break the stigma that keeps men silent,
          ensuring everyone—man, woman, or child—can seek help without shame.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          We believe in <strong>confidentiality</strong>, <strong>cultural sensitivity</strong>, and
          <strong> empathy</strong>. By bridging the gap between Nigerian traditions and Western laws,
          we aim to help men navigate challenges like immigration, domestic abuse, and family disputes
          with greater confidence.
