        <p style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
          Save The Men is a community-focused initiative established to address the unique
          challenges Nigerian men face in the diaspora. We understand the cultural, legal,
          and social barriers that can prevent men from seeking help when they experience
          domestic abuse or other crises.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          Our vision is to create a supportive environment where men can access resources,
          connect with advocates, and find hope in difficult times. We collaborate with
          various experts to ensure every man receives the right kind of support.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          Whether you need emotional guidance, legal referrals, or simply a listening ear,
          Save The Men is here to help you navigate life abroad safely and confidently.
